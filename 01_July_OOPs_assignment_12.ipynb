        "The primary purpose of the self parameter is to allow access to the attributes and methods of the class within its own methods. When a method is called on an instance of a class, the instance is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, which is represented by the self parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using self, you can access and modify the instance variables (attributes) of the class, as well as call other methods associated with the class. It enables the methods to work with the specific instance that invoked them, allowing them to manipulate the instance's state and perform actions specific to that instance.\n",
        "\n",
